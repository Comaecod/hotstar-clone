## Box Sizing

box-sizing is a CSS property that controls how the total width and height of an element is calculated. By default, the box-sizing property is set to content-box, which means that the total width and height of an element is equal to the sum of its content width and height plus any padding and borders that are applied.

However, when you set box-sizing to border-box, the total width and height of an element includes its content, padding, and borders. This means that any padding or borders you add to an element will not affect its overall dimensions.
